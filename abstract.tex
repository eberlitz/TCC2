\begin{abstract}
The ability to identify the semantic similarity between words has been a subject of research very explored in the last years, because it is related to a series of activities of the area of natural language processing like information retrieval, text summarization, categorization and generation, database schema matching, question answering, machine translation, and others. Most of question answering and information extraction systems use WordNet to search for synonyms in their search engine. However, the expansion of terms using WordNet has several problems. They are of manual construction, time-consuming and expensive, and for this reason, not all links will be present and their quality varies from language to language, as also, it is not available for all languages. Distributional-based approaches like word embeddings have successfully been used to cover out-of-vocabulary items in WordNet. Thus, with the possibility of access to pre-trained word embeddings including in the Portuguese language and the need to improve the way of expanding related terms of query systems to ontological bases used by systems of questions answering and information retrieval, the present work aims to improve the accuracy and recall of these related terms expansion through the use of word embeddings. Also, we propose to adapt existing studies regarding the addition of syntactic context in the training process of word embeddings to a Brazilian Portuguese corpus, to check if the results will be, similar or not. The evaluation will be composed of a qualitative analyses and also a quantitative one over two common datasets.
