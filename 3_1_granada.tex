\subsection{Comparing Semantic Relatedness between Word Pairs in Portuguese Using Wikipedia}

In this paper, \citetexto{GranadaSV14} presents a new dataset for evaluating Distributional Similarity Models in Portuguese. For this, they translated the word pairs from the well-know baseline for semantic relatedness evaluation in English called RG65 created by \citetexto{Rubenstein1965ContextualCO}. The original dataset contains judgements from 51 human subjects for 65 word pairs. To generate the PT65 they translated all the word-pairs and evaluated them with 50 human subjects. They compared the human scores with previous works and also performed a qualitative evaluation using Latent semantic analysis (LSA) models generated from Wikipedia articles. The correlation scores obtained were closer to the scores achieved by other works that targeted another language. With the experiement they observed that the semantic similarity can be transfered across languages, but for Portuguese, a manual evaluation had better results. 

With this, we intend to use the PT65 as a gold-standard for evaluating semantic similarity and relatedness between words with word embeddings models and the WordNet.
