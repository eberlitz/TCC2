\subsection{Distributional and Knowledge-Based Approaches for Computing Portuguese Word Similarity}

In this work, \citetexto{gonccalo2018distributional}, presents several approaches for computing word similarity in Portuguese where they make an extensive comparison between these different approaches, which includes word embeddings and lexical knowledge bases. The comparison aims, for each approach, the effectiveness in this particular task as well as the quality and coverage of words. For the evaluation, they do a qualitative analysis of the results based on four datasets that have been recently adapted to Portuguese, PT65, SimLex-999, WordSim-353, and RareWords.
The results of this work indicate that distributional models capture relatedness better than lexical knowledge bases which seems to be better suited genuine similarity.
